# SPDEv1.2
SPDE is a bioinformatic software. Its functions are responsible for biological sequence processing and data extraction.
It is an open-source software. If you have any questions, you can contant me by xudongzhuanyong@163.com
Note: the github website seemed not to allow users upload the software whose size is more than 100 M.
So, If you want to download MacOS version of SPDE, you can go to the website of https://pan.baidu.com/s/1_3NJI07lC4iBt4Z96by-Sw
extraction code: 4alh
Sorry, compared with the windows versions, two functions is deleted in MacOS version, as they did not work well in MacOS.
I will add them in subsequent version. Thanks!
When you install the SPDE in MacOS, It Will be installed in 'Application' which usually store software.
Moving SPDE to other place will influence its functions.
